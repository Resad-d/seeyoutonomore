# seeyoutonomore
My first (small) game I made in pure JavaScript. Goal is surviving till music ends (5 mintues).

# My Game

A simple browser-based game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It is my first game. I'm planning for new games in the Godot engine. 

I do not own either the [art](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1148558711225448195/) or the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1CF2PudwTg).

## How to Run

Because the game uses **ES modules** (`<script type="module">`), it must be served over `http://` or `https://` â€”  
opening the HTML file directly with `file://` will cause a **CORS error**.

### Use a Local Server
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Resad-d/seeyoutonomore.git
   cd seeyoutonomore
   ```

2. **Run a local server:**

   **Python 3:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 3000
   ```

   **Node.js (using `serve`):**
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```

3. **Open in your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/seeyoutonomore.html
   ```
